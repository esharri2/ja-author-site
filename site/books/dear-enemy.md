synopsis: >-
  A woman discovers a hand in the garden, a wrist in the sink, and resigns herself to stand by and watch as her lover reduces herself to an eyeball. DEAR ENEMY, is a collection of twenty-one depraved tales. A dead family strokes their rage while wandering in and out of other family photographs. Another woman wrestles with marital ambivalence as a bear carries her husband off their front porch and into a nearby forest. These stories are haunted by strange, inexplicable, and sinister yearnings. With the terse simplicity of fairy tales, DEAR ENEMY, warps familiar fictional forms and serves a vision as intimate as it is alien.
