title: NONE OF THIS IS AN INVITATION
publisher: Astrophil Press
genre: Mystery/horror
synopsis: >+
  A mystery, a queer hauntology, and an experiment that attempts to conjure the
  uncanny in the cliché. One freakishly wintry night in Texas, Alex enters the
  woods of Bidwell Ridge, and–like the girls of urban legends–is never seen
  again. Two decades later–after Nina’s many failed attempts to reinvent
  herself–Alex returns in phantasmic form beckoning Nina back to the enigmatic
  dreamscape of their Texas girlhood.
