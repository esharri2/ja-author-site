title: That Woman Could Be You
publisher: BlazeVOX
genre: Nonfiction/poetry
synopsis: "That Woman Could Be You is an orphic documentary of the circadian, an
  archive of queer and quotidian rituals, an observant meditation on the
  ephemerality and defiance of chronic pain, desire, and grief as they manifest
  in daily acts. This intrinsically sapphic & feminist project does not
  chronicle an excursion so much as the stillness of interiority: Alexander
  fluctuates between belief and disbelief at the news of her brother’s death and
  Nao manages the fatigue and breathlessness of heart surgery. Meanwhile the
  Interstates carry them from Louisiana to Texas to Colorado; to work and away
  from it. That Woman Could Be You lends a euphoric, nostalgic, and dreamlike
  beauty to the everydayness of diurnal tasks. It is about moving through the
  world together, as women, in Nao’s case a Vietnamese woman, and the newness of
  their love and life together."

  - text: "Like Anne Charlotte Robertson’s Five Year Diary seen through a fervid
      haze, its Super 8 frames fractaling in and out of memory’s forlorn
      theatrics, the pieces in this book invite the reader on a jaunt of
      vanishingly small, gigantic, public, and intimate dimensions. Accept the
      invitation. Reel with all the ways That Woman Could be You.  "

  - text: "The book, visually, looks stunning –– reminds me of The Fear of Losing
      Eurydice by Julieta Campos ––and the poems are so mundanely mystical that
      there’s no difference between the physical and the spiritual, the ‘me’ and
      the ‘you’. "

  - text: "If a love story has a beginning, middle, and end, then this is a book of
      the middle, of the hundred middles –– of the rice, lemons, sweatpants ,
      workdays, rented rooms –– that deep connection is made of. Danger, death,
      and chronic pain wait in the dark, so “we [walk] home like two lamp
      posts.” Familiar and strange, this wonderfully intimate, genre-bending
      book is a gift of trust to the reader. It’s like finding a witty, lyrical
      letter handwritten on the back pages of a library book you never want to
      return. "

  - text: "Reading That Woman Could Be You is an overwhelming immersion in an
      intimate world of knowing and unknowing. The stunning work is steeped in
      love and grief and, most of all, in the persistent genius needed to expose
      them.  "

  - text: "What does it mean to be a woman, that Other? This book cannot tell you
      any more than your mother—remembered, fictitious—can. But what if every
      person you ever loved was Jessica Alexander who was Vi Khi Nao who was a
      singular writer with two heads and one heart and a thousand brains? But
      every person you ever loved was a verb. Grieve, thrust, probe, sear—for
      example. Not your mother, not remembered or fictitious, but language, in
      all its glory and precision and ambiguity. That is this book. And if you
      let it, this book will crack you open, replace your insides with ferns,
      shrimps, televisions: or tiny bits of the souls of two singular writers. "

  - text: An unconventional masterpiece from two of the most transcendent writers
      working in America today. I dare you to read this collaboration and not be
      inspired in your own life and art.
