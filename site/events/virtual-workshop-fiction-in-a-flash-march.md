title: VIRTUAL WORKSHOP | FICTION IN A FLASH | MARCH
location: THE IOWA SUMMER WRITING FESTIVAL | ZOOM
description: >-
  This course explores techniques for building evocative settings, compelling
  characters, suspenseful narratives, and (un)believable worlds through the
  study of flash fiction. Because flash fiction is a narrative microcosm, it
  provides the ideal medium through which to study the mechanics of story,
  sentence by sentence. Writing flash fiction is also an excellent exercise in
  precision and economy. It’s an exercise in understanding the spine of a story.
  In this course, we’ll study the fundamentals of story (inciting incident,
  rising action, climax, dialogue, scene, and summary) through various works of
  flash fiction. Students will generate new work and have multiple flash
  workshops.  


  Through a combination of collaborative craft talks, writing exercises, and peer feedback, participants will learn how to turn tension into full-blown conflict in swift and efficient strokes. This class is for beginning and experienced writers alike. It’s for students who wish to grasp the fundamental elements of story in their bare-bones form.   


  While participants will be given prompts to help them generate new flash fictions, they are also welcome to revise existing flash fictions, or to transform existing material into flash fictions. Participants will share their responses in class and receive instructor feedback.  


  While we’ll look, specifically, at published flash fiction, this course welcomes writers of all genres who want to better grasp the core elements of narrative structure.  


  This course includes a 30-minute one-on-one Zoom conference with the instructor.
