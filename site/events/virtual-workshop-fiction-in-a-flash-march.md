title: "IN PERSON WORKSHOP | SETTING: THE ART OF WRITING A WORLD | JULY 13 - 18"
location: THE IOWA SUMMER WRITING FESTIVAL | IN PERSON
description: >-
  Whether your story unfolds in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, an urban
  stockyard, a college campus or a quiet neighborhood, setting is a vital
  element. It shapes mood, deepens themes, and influences character. Setting is
  not necessarily a lengthy description of native plants and trees, although—if
  it’s integral to the unfolding drama—it can be. Nor is setting simply a
  backdrop. Setting is more akin to the air we breathe and, in some stories, the
  way we breathe it. In this course, we’ll explore techniques that evoke
  atmosphere, integrate sensory details, and make setting an active part of the
  plot. Together we’ll analyze literary examples of iconic worlds and identify
  the elements that make them vivid and unforgettable. We’ll consider the scope
  of setting, by comparing stories whose drama sprawls across entire towns to
  those contained within a home’s four walls. We’ll consider how sensory details
  create mood, genre, and atmosphere. Since all worlds—whether speculative,
  contemporary, or historical—have their unique histories and rules, we’ll study
  a variety of techniques for worldbuilding. We’ll use the language of film,
  too, to think about framing place through long-shots and close-ups. Whether
  you’re seeking inspiration for a new project or revising something old, this
  course will help you hone the contours of your fictional worlds. Participants
  will be given writing prompts at the end of each class and will share their
  short responses on the following day. Feedback will be given in class. Through
  a combination of collaborative craft talks, writing exercises, and peer
  feedback, participants will learn how to infuse their settings with sensual
  details, to evoke tension and mood through setting, as well as how to frame
  their settings. This course is for beginning and experienced writers alike.
  Participants will revise existing material or generate new material in
  response to daily prompts. Participants will share their responses in class
  and receive instructor and peer feedback orally. While we’ll draw largely on
  published fictions for inspiration, this course welcomes writers of all genres
  who wish to imagine and compose evocative settings. In this workshop, we will
  generate new writing through guided exercises and prompts; offer
  feedback/first impressions on writing you produce in our week.
