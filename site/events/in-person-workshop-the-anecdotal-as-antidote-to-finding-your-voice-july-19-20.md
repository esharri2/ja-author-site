title: IN PERSON WORKSHOP | THE ANECDOTAL AS ANTIDOTE TO FINDING YOUR VOICE |
  JULY 19 - 20
location: IOWA CITY
description: >-
  We’re adept at narrativizing our own lives. Even the dullest and most dreadful
  experiences become fodder for a good barstool story. Yet when faced with the
  blank page, too often our skill and our joy abandon us. In this generative
  workshop, we’ll transform our rich experience as veteran storytellers into the
  key to unlock our voices and our narratives. The goal of this course is to
  translate our stories to the page, to mine our memories for sensual details,
  and to find new meanings in the stories we keep telling. This course is for
  poets and prose writers who long to write about their lives but don’t know
  where to begin. We’ll draw inspiration from published work across genres,
  building an arsenal of stylistic and structural approaches to writing. Through
  a guided discussion, generative writing exercises, and peer feedback
  participants will tap into their wellspring of self-narratives and explore
  those moments where the page invites greater depth and nuance. This class is
  for beginning and experienced writers alike. In this workshop, we will
  generate new writing through guided exercises and prompts; offer
  feedback/first impressions on writing you produce in our weekend.
