title: "YOUR LIFE IN A FLASH: WRITING MICRO-MEMOIRS"
location: ZOOM | APRIL 3, 10, 17, & 24 | THURSDAY NIGHTS 7-9 EST
description: >-
  We’re adept at narrativizing our lives. Even the dull and dreadful become
  fodder for a good story. But when faced with a blank page, too often our skill
  and joy abandon us. In this generative workshop, we’ll transform our rich
  experience as veteran storytellers into the key that unlocks our voices and
  our narratives. Whether you’re writing for yourself, your loved ones, or for
  publication, the goal of this course is to translate your stories to the page,
  to mine your memories for sensual details, and to find new meanings in the
  stories you keep telling.


  Through a combination of collaborative craft-talks, writing exercises, and peer feedback, participants will develop the tools to infuse their writing with detail, tension, and purpose. This class welcomes beginning and experienced writers alike. 


  This is a workshop. Participants will generate 3 pages a week and receive written feedback from me. This class is ideal for writers who wish to commit to and develop a consistent writing practice, but need accountability and community to support those efforts. The course is $300 for the month and will meet over Zoom.


  Join me in APRIL and write your micro-memoirs!
