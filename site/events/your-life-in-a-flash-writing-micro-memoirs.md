  This OCTOBER, I’m offering a Flash Writing Workshop—a focused, four-week space
  for writers ready to commit to their creative practice.


  This workshop is designed to give you two powerful things: community and accountability. Each week, your writing will be the heart of our work. You'll submit anything from one paragraph to three pages, and we’ll spend the bulk of class offering thoughtful, supportive feedback on each submission.


  We'll wrap each session with a short craft talk and an optional writing prompt to spark new ideas for the following week. Prompts are there to inspire—but you’re always welcome to follow your own creative path.


  Who’s this for? Memoirists, poets, fiction writers—whether you're just starting out, working on a draft, or returning to a project that’s been calling your name. Past participants have included:


  Published authors

  Writers preparing work for publication

  Storytellers capturing family histories

  Creative people exploring or deepening a writing habit

  The only requirement is that you write and submit something each week.


  Details:


  Cost: $250

  When: Wednesdays, 7–9PM EST

  Dates: October 8, 15, 22, and 29

  Where: Zoom

  Class size: Small, so everyone’s work gets read and discussed weekly
