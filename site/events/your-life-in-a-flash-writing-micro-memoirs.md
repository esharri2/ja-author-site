title: "YOUR LIFE IN A FLASH: WRITING MICRO-MEMOIRS"
location: ZOOM | APRIL 9, 16, 23, 30 | WEDNESDAY NIGHTS 7-9 EST
description: >-
  We’re adept at narrativizing our lives. Even the dull and dreadful become
  fodder for a good story. But when faced with a blank page, too often our skill
  and joy abandon us. In this generative workshop, we’ll transform our rich
  experience as veteran storytellers into the key that unlocks our voices and
  our narratives. Whether you’re writing for yourself, your loved ones, or for
  publication, the goal of this course is to translate your stories to the page,
  to mine your memories for sensual details, and to find new meanings in the
  stories you keep telling. While tapping into the personal, oral tradition of
  storytelling can be a rich source of inspiration, participants need not limit
  themselves to writing micro-memoirs. I draw on examples from fiction, poetry,
  and memoir to illustrate certain techniques, and I invite participants to
  write in the mode or genre that feels appropriate to them.


  This is a workshop. Participants generate and submit 1-3 pages each week, and receive written feedback from me. This class is ideal for writers who wish to commit to and develop a consistent writing practice, but need accountability and community to support those efforts. The course is $250 for the month and will meet over Zoom. I offer sliding scale, too, if cost is an inhibiting factor.


  Join me in APRIL and write your micro-memoirs!
